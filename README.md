Announcements of changes impacting Ansible collection contributors and maintainers.

[Current open issues](https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/issues) and [related discussions](https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/discussions).

This repository is created in accordance with the [Community decision](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/51) as a replacement for [Issue 45](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/issues/45) to track changes that Ansible collection maintainers should be aware of.

If you are a collection maintainer, please subscribe to this repository using the `Watch` button in the upper right corner of the GitHub web interface. If you do not want to get notifications about related discussions, subscribe to issues only.

The news are made via **issues** - one per announcement. Issues must not be used for anything else than announcements.

**Discussions** can be used to discuss announcements. Do not use discussions for announcements.

# Guidelines

- Please do **not** create issues to ask questions. Join us on [Matrix or IRC](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#real-time-chat) or [create a Discussion](https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/discussions/new) and link it to the issue instead.
- Please avoid unnecessary discussions in issues, use the `Discussions` feature as described above. Every comment posted will notify **a lot** of folks! You can add reactions to an issue/a comment instead for feedback that does not annoy everyone.
- If you reference an issue in this repository in a PR, avoid writing `Fixes`, `Closes`, `Resolves`, or any other [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) before it so that the issue is not closed when the PR is merged.
